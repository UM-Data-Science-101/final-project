    "In this final project you be analyzing a data set using techniques from Data Science 101. The goal of this project is to demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learned in this course to a real-world data set. You will be graded on the quality of your analysis, the clarity of your code, and the effectiveness of your communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section will contain a brief description of the task, followed by a code cell where you will write your code. You should write your code in the code cell and run it to generate the output. You will need to interpret the results of your analysis in a way that is understandable to people without a background in statistics or Python programming You should use markdown to format your text in a legible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual Effort Policy**: You may use any resources you like to complete this project, including the internet, textbooks, and discussions with other people. You may also use GenAI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT. It is expected that students will use GenAI tools for writing code, and no citation will be required for GenAI assisted code. For the written portions of the project, use of GenAI should be cited in a way that make clear how the GenAI tool was used. The *GenAI Appendix* section at the end provides a template you can use to indicate how you used tools like ChatGPT for each section. You should be prepared to explain any code or written responses that you submit upon request.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will analyze two data sets from \"Wolves and Moose of Isle Royale\" project. The data sets contain information about the populations of wolves and moose on Isle Royale, an island in Lake Superior. The data sets include information about the number of wolves and moose on the island, as well as other variables that may be related to the populations of wolves and moose.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Isle Royale is a remote wilderness island, isolated by the frigid waters of Lake Superior, and home to populations of wolves and moose. As predator and prey, their lives and deaths are linked in a drama that is timeless and historic. Their lives are historic because we have been documenting their lives for more than five decades. This research project is the longest continuous study of any predator-prey system in the world. ([Source](https://isleroyalewolf.org/overview/overview/at_a_glance.html))\n",
